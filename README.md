# README

## From Apr 11, 2023 **Brandon Lu** (Sorry for the American date format) 

### This contains
- Code from Jasmine to directly import the csv files
- The now modified code (By brandon lu)
(Go to #Generic function taking a list of suburbs and geolocation data DONE)

### You might want to look at
- Jasmine files `Jasmine_self_test_sat_night.Rmd`
    - Her files are dependent on the `l_files` folder
    - Note that I've changed the absolute path to `relative` path, so once you've downloaded it, you should be able to run with without any modification

- `Project2_1901_v0.Rmd`
    - This is my modified version, look at #Generic function taking a list of suburbs and geolocation data 
    - It automatically generates the `csv_cache` folder if it doesn't exist and it's dependent on It

### My progress
You can see my progress report in the `Brandon_Lu_stat_rep.md` file:
- Create the `Generic function taking a list of suburbs and geolocation data:` section
- Modify the absolute path
- Debug the `geo_coder` `address` not character problem (sorry for the American spelling)
- Reorganize all the files that the two coding memembers have sent me; I've put them all in this very GitHub repository
- Discussed with Jasmine about some changes that can be made to make the result clearer (Saturday evening)

### Implication of my work
- **empower us to mass analyze data and expand the scope of research**
- achive modulization and encapsulation to make debugging and coding easier
- establish the GitHub repository to make code sharing easier
- streamline the development process
- ensure preliminary compatibility with other group member's code

## Useful resources for learning markdown
This file is written in `markdonw` as a `md` format. It's the foundation on which the `rmd` format is built.
